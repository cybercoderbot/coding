/*154. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
(i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]). Find the minimum element.
The array may contain duplicates.

Example 1:
Input: [1,3,5] Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: [2,2,2,0,1] Output: 0

When num[mid] == num[right], we couldn't sure the position of minimum in mid's left or right, so 
just let upper bound reduce one.
