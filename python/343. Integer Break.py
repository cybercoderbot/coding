343. Integer Break
Medium

Given an integer n, break it into the sum of k positive integers, where k >= 2, and maximize the product of those integers.

Return the maximum product you can get.

Example 1:
Input: n = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: 2 = 1 + 1, 1 Ã— 1 = 1.

Example 2:
Input: n = 10
Output: 36
Explanation: 10 = 3 + 3 + 4, 3 Ã— 3 Ã— 4 = 36.

        Approach 2 - math

        An simple explanation:
        The first thing we should consider is : What is the max product if we break a number N into two factors?

        I use a function to express this product: f = x * (N-x)

        When x=N/2, we get the maximum of this function.

        However, factors should be integers. Thus the maximum is (N/2)*(N/2) when N is even or (N-1)/2 *(N+1)/2 when N is odd.

        When the maximum of f is larger than N, we should do the break.

        (N/2) * (N/2) >= N, then N>=4

        (N-1)/2 *(N+1)/2 N>=5, then N >= 5

        These two expressions mean that factors should be less than 4, otherwise we can do the break and get a better product. The factors in last result should be 1, 2 or 3. Obviously, 1 should be abandoned. Thus, the factors of the perfect product should be 2 or 3.

        If an optimal product contains a factor f >= 4, then you can replace it with factors 2 and f-2 without losing optimality, as 2*(f-2) = 2f-4 >= f. So you never need a factor greater than or equal to 4, meaning you only need factors 1, 2 and 3 (and 1 is of course wasteful and you'd only use it for n=2 and n=3, where it's needed).

        For the rest, 3*3 is simply better than 2*2*2, so you'd never use 2 more than twice.
