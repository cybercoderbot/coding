        435. Non-overlapping Intervals (greedy alg)
        Return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make 
        the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

        Heuristic: always pick the interval with the earliest end time. 
        Then you can get the max number of non-overlaps (or min number to remove). Reason: 
        the interval with the earliest end time produces the max capacity to hold rest intervals.
        E.g. Suppose current earliest end time of the rest intervals is x. Then available time slot left for other intervals is [x:]. If we choose another interval with end time y, then available time slot would be [y:]. Since x â‰¤ y, there is no way [y:] can hold more intervals then [x:]. Thus, the heuristic holds.

        Therefore, we can sort interval by ending time and keep track of current earliest end time. Once next interval's start time is earlier than current end time, then we have to remove one interval. Otherwise, we update earliest end time.
