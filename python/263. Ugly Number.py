263. Ugly Number
Easy

An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

Given an integer n, return true if n is an ugly number.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 6
Output: true
Explanation: 6 = 2 Ã— 3
Example 2:

Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
Example 3:

Input: n = 14
Output: false
Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.

# Solution
# Per the definition of ugly number, only positive numbers can be ugly. In the first step, exclude non-positive numbers.

# Loop through factors 2, 3 and 5, and check if num can be divided by the factor.
# If a number if ugly, then it will reach 1 eventually.


class Solution:
    def isUgly(self, n: int) -> bool:
        if n <= 0:
            return False

        for factor in [2, 3, 5]:
            while n % factor == 0:
                n //= factor

        return n == 1
