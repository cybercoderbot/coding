/*Given a group of two strings, you need to find the longest uncommon subsequence of this group of two strings. 
The longest uncommon subsequence is defined as the longest subsequence of one of these strings and this subsequence 
should not be any subsequence of the other strings.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from one sequence by deleting some characters without changing the 
order of the remaining elements. Trivially, any string is a subsequence of itself and an empty string is a subsequence
of any string.

The input will be two strings, and the output needs to be the length of the longest uncommon subsequence. If the longest
uncommon subsequence doesn't exist, return -1.

Example 1:
Input: "aba", "cdc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest uncommon subsequence is "aba" (or "cdc"), 
because "aba" is a subsequence of "aba", 
but not a subsequence of any other strings in the group of two strings. */

class Solution {
public:
    int findLUSlength(string a, string b) {
        /*两个字符串的情况，如果两个字符串相等，那么一定没有非共同子序列，
        反之，如果两个字符串不等，那么较长的那个字符串就是最长非共同子序列*/
        return a==b? -1 : max(a.size(), b.size());
    }
};
